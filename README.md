# Music-genre-classifier
Implementing different machine learning models on input music data and finding the most efficient method.
We have compared KNN and other ensemble features on GITZAN Dataset, filtered features, extracted the top 30 features, implemented parameter tuning and figured the final efficiencies. The project is yet to be finished, we'll be adding an option for CNN too, along with that, inputing music audio from user to filter features and select the required ones after DCT noise cleansing and then compare to find the final genre to be identified.
